# Introduction

Network simulators are a significant tool in network programming. They allow researchers to observe complex/dynamic network environments and experiment with new protocols and algorithms.

One highly cited and credible network simulator is [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/).

With the development of recent machine learning and AI (artificial intelligent) techniques, researchers have started to apply machine learning in network programming.

As such, [ns3-ai](https://github.com/hust-diangroup/ns3-ai) was created and has been used in recent studies to apply techniques like reinforcement learning to network programming.

In an effort to shed light on how ns3 and ns3-ai works, we've created this tutorial to bettr understand (and hopefully save some time) in anyone's pursuit to utilize ns3-ai in their own research.

We'll explain ns3-ai, walkthrough the installation process, and run the rl-tcp example while explaining the results.
